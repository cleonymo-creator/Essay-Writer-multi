You've kinda gotta feel a bit sorry for Hull. At least they tried.

TEXT 2: (POSTED BY GetALife, CRITIC OF CRYSTAL PALACE FANS)
How Fickle can you get, all the Palace fans wanted HIPPO HEAD out after the drubbing they got off sunderland, now you think hes the best manager going, he is a boring gum chewing greedy cheat. its people like him what give football a bad name should never of been allowed back in football

TEXT 3: (POSTED BY Eagle77, CRYSTAL PALACE SUPPORTER)
EEEEAAAAAAGGGGGLLLLLEEESSSSS!!!! We are PALACE super PALACE the eagles r flying high at the mo looking forward to Brighton next season now. COYP

TEXT 4: (POSTED BY ithasnthappenedyet, CRITIC OF AN INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTOR)
@theLegEndLad Always first on every posting (does he work at BBC???? lol) You really are pathetic. Sure HYS, but no need to be sooo arrogant. C'mon BBC, shoulda removed the comments for being off-topic.

TEXT 5: (POSTED BY sports_mad, SPORTS TEACHER)
I'm a Palace fan, but hope to see Hull fighting back before long. Hull suffered from two consecutive matches where they simply imploded within their play. V. careless errors in defence. Palace soaked up any pressure and capitalised on the break. Palace, though, still need to raise their game and evaluate the toils of this season.

Gutted, no passion, no fight, went down with a whimper ☹☹☹☹`,

        foundation: `## Analysing Purpose and Audience (Foundation)

Look at why people are writing and who they're writing to. Different purposes (like supporting a team, criticizing someone, or giving expert opinion) lead to different language choices.

### Different Purposes to Identify
- Supporting your team (Texts 1, 3)
- Criticizing other fans or people (Texts 2, 4)
- Giving expert analysis (Text 5)
- Expressing disappointment (Text 6)

### How Purpose Affects Language

        foundation: `## Analysing Social Role and Register (Foundation)

Look at how people's jobs, expertise, or social position affects how they write. A teacher writes differently from a regular fan because of their role and knowledge.

### Different Social Roles
- Sports teacher (Text 5) - uses expert knowledge and formal language
- Regular fans (Texts 1, 3, 6) - use emotional, informal language
- Critics (Texts 2, 4) - use direct, confrontational language

### How Role Affects Language
