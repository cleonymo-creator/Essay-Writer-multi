You should use the provided extract as a starting point but develop your analysis with your own examples and linguistic knowledge. Consider different contexts where persuasion occurs and evaluate the effectiveness of various linguistic techniques.",
  originalTask: `## Exam Question
Using this extract as a starting point, analyse and evaluate the ways in which either speakers or writers use language to achieve their goals by persuading others.

## Mark Scheme Summary
Responses should demonstrate sophisticated methods of analysis using appropriate terminology, show detailed critical understanding of linguistic concepts, and provide confident analysis of contextual factors. Top responses will show perceptive discussion of how meaning is constructed through persuasive language choices.`,
  sourceMaterial: `Two examples show the importance of language strategies in allowing writers or speakers to achieve their goals:

1. A minister is disturbed by the fact that the public continue to use the church car park while shopping nearby. As a consequence, there are not usually enough parking spaces for those attending church meetings on weekdays. His efforts fail until he comes up with a sign that reads THOU SHALT NOT PARK.

2. At an informal meeting, the Head of Department says to another member of the university "John I've got a problem – that is, we've got a problem and I think you can help solve it."

The language choices here are significant in establishing persuasive power.`,
