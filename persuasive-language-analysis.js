  originalTask: `## Exam Question
Using this extract as a starting point, analyse and evaluate the ways in which either speakers or writers use language to achieve their goals by persuading others.

## Mark Scheme Summary
High-level responses typically:
- Use accurate, wide-ranging linguistic terminology (lexis, grammar, discourse, pragmatics, register)
- Analyse *and* evaluate how language choices construct meaning, power and relationships in context
- Range across relevant contexts (e.g. domestic interaction, politics, charity appeals, advertising/marketing, classroom discourse, legal discourse, online communication)
- Integrate brief, relevant theory where useful (e.g. Fairclough’s synthetic personalisation; Giles’ Accommodation Theory; Sinclair & Coulthard’s classroom discourse model)
- Support points with concise textual evidence and clear evaluative judgements about effectiveness
`,
  sourceMaterial: `Two examples show the importance of language strategies in allowing writers or speakers to achieve their goals:

1. A minister is disturbed by the fact that the public continue to use the church car park while shopping nearby. As a consequence, there are not usually enough parking spaces for those attending church meetings on weekdays. His efforts fail until he comes up with a sign that reads THOU SHALT NOT PARK.

2. At an informal meeting, the Head of Department says to another member of the university "John I've got a problem – that is, we've got a problem and I think you can help solve it."

The language choices here are significant in establishing persuasive power.`,

        foundation: `## Analysing the Extract Examples (Foundation)

Look closely at the two examples and explain how the language works to persuade people.

### Example 1: "THOU SHALT NOT PARK"
- This copies the language from the Ten Commandments
- It sounds more serious and important
- People might obey it because it sounds religious

### Example 2: "I've got a problem - we've got a problem"
- Changes from "I" to "we" 
- Makes the other person feel included
- More likely to help if it's "our" problem

### What to Write About
- Explain what each example does
- Say why these techniques work
- Use simple language terms like "formal language" or "inclusive pronouns"
`,

      title: "Persuasive Language in Political Discourse",
      type: "body",
      learningMaterial: {
        foundation: `## Political Language (Foundation)

Politicians use language carefully to persuade people to agree with them or vote for them. Use examples you know (from speeches, debates, leaflets or campaign slogans).

### Common Techniques
- Repeating key words or phrases (so the message sticks)
- Using "we" / "our" to create unity with the audience
- Making promises using the future tense and modal verbs ("will", "can", "must")
- Using emotive language to trigger feelings like hope or fear

### What to Write About
- Give one or two short examples and zoom in on the wording
- Explain how the language positions the audience (e.g. as responsible citizens)
- Say whether the technique is effective and why (for that audience and context)

### Simple Examples (Any You Know)
- "Take back control" / "Build back better" - short, memorable, evaluative lexis
- Repeating a three-part list (a "rule of three") in a speech
`,
        intermediate: `## Persuasive Language in Political Discourse (Intermediate)

Examine how political speakers employ rhetorical and pragmatic strategies to influence public opinion and voting behaviour.

### Key Linguistic Strategies
- Rhetorical patterning (anaphora, epistrophe, tricolon, parallelism)
- Inclusive pronouns and deictic choices to construct national identity ("we", "our country")
- Metaphor and framing to shape how issues are understood (e.g. "battle", "journey")
- Modality and evaluative lexis to present viewpoints as necessary or inevitable
- Presupposition and implicature (what is treated as "already true")

### Contextual Factors
- Institutional settings (parliamentary debate, party conference, broadcast interview)
- Audience design (different language choices for different voter groups)
- Time pressure and quotability (soundbites, slogans, headlines)

### Analysis Points
- How syntax and rhythm support memorability (short clauses, balanced structures)
- How speakers manage face and authority (politeness vs attack)
- Evaluation of effectiveness: immediate impact vs long-term credibility
`,
        advanced: `## Persuasive Language in Political Discourse (Advanced)

Analyse the manipulation of linguistic resources in political communication, considering ideology, power and the management of public consent.

### Advanced Rhetorical and Pragmatic Analysis
- Examine how political identities are constructed through discourse (in-groups/out-groups, "us vs them")
- Analyse how metaphorical frameworks shape policy understanding and limit alternative readings
- Consider how institutional constraints (questioning formats, turn-taking, time limits) shape persuasive choices

### Critical Discourse Perspectives
- Apply Fairclough's three-dimensional framework (text, discursive practice, social practice)
- Examine how political language reproduces or challenges power relations (e.g. nominalisation, agency deletion)
- Consider "synthetic personalisation" and how politicians simulate intimacy with mass audiences

### Sophisticated Examples (Choose Brief, Specific Data)
- Strategic shifts between formal register and more conversational features to appear both competent and relatable
- Regional/dialect features or audience accommodation to build solidarity (link to Giles' Accommodation Theory)
- Attack/defence sequences in interviews: evasion, reframing, and agenda control

### Evaluation Criteria
- How different audiences may interpret the same wording differently
- The ethics of persuasive tactics (misleading presuppositions, scapegoating, euphemism)
- Cross-context comparison: speeches vs interviews vs campaign writing

      title: "Persuasion in Advertising and Marketing",
      type: "body",
      learningMaterial: {
        foundation: `## Advertising and Campaign Language (Foundation)

Advertising and campaigning use persuasive language to make people *do* something (buy, donate, sign up, click, vote). You can write about commercial adverts *and* charity/public-information campaigns.

### Common Techniques
- Short, catchy slogans (easy to remember)
- Positive adjectives and superlatives ("best", "perfect", "new")
- Imperatives telling you what to do ("Try", "Join", "Donate")
- Creating urgency ("today", "limited time", "act now")
- Testimonials and authority claims ("experts say", statistics, awards)

### What to Write About
- Give examples you know (a poster, leaflet, website banner, charity appeal)
- Explain how the wording influences the reader's choices
- Say if the language is ethical/effective and why

### Easy Examples
- "Just do it" - imperative mood
- "Because you're worth it" - direct address and flattery
- "Only £1 a week can..." - small-number framing in charity appeals
`,
        intermediate: `## Persuasion in Advertising and Marketing (Intermediate)

Analyse how promotional discourse employs linguistic strategies to influence behaviour and construct identities (consumer, donor, supporter).

### Linguistic Techniques
- Imperatives and second-person address (synthetic conversation with the reader)
- Comparative/superlative constructions and vague evaluators ("better", "premium", "quality")
- Semantic fields (luxury, health, family, safety) and connotative meanings
- Modality ("can", "will") and certainty markers to strengthen claims
- Phonological patterning (alliteration, rhyme, rhythm) to aid recall

### Contextual Considerations
- Target demographic and register choices (youthful slang vs formal reassurance)
- Medium constraints (print, packaging, websites, email subject lines)
- Regulation, disclaimers and "truth claims" (hedging, small print, euphemism)

### Analysis Framework
- Explore presupposition/implicature (what the text assumes you already agree with)
- Consider stance and evaluation (how positivity/negativity is built into lexis)
- Evaluate ethical implications: manipulation, fear appeals, guilt, stereotyping
`,
        advanced: `## Persuasion in Advertising and Marketing (Advanced)

Examine how promotional and campaigning discourse shapes beliefs and actions through lexico-grammatical choice, pragmatic inference and ideological positioning.

### Advanced Linguistic Analysis
- Analyse how texts construct a "model reader" (the kind of person you are invited to be)
- Examine agency and responsibility (who is blamed/credited) through transitivity and nominalisation
- Explore how evaluation is embedded via Appraisal-style resources (attitude, graduation, engagement) and intensification

### Critical Perspectives
- Apply Fairclough's notions of marketisation and synthetic personalisation to show how institutions imitate intimacy
- Consider how persuasive texts normalise values (consumerism, charity "deservingness", health and body ideals)
- Use critical stylistics ideas (e.g. how choices hide or foreground power and ideology)

### Sophisticated Case Studies (Pick One or Two)
- Charity appeals: storytelling, direct address, quantified impact, moral positioning ("you can change a life")
- Green/ethical marketing: strategic vagueness ("eco-friendly") and hedging to avoid falsifiable claims
- Public information campaigns: authority, warnings, and the balance of fear vs reassurance

### Evaluation Dimensions
- Short-term compliance vs long-term trust and brand/organisational credibility
- Differential reception: how social class, age and experience affect interpretation
- Consumer protection: disclaimers, clarity, and accountability

      learningMaterial: {
        foundation: `## Online Persuasion (Foundation)

People use digital communication (texts, posts, comments, emails) to persuade others every day.

### Common Online Techniques
- Hashtags to join movements and signal stance
- Tagging/@mentions to directly address people or invite wider audiences
- Emojis, punctuation and spelling choices to show tone (e.g. !!!, ALL CAPS)
- Sharing/retweeting to spread messages quickly
- Likes and comments as social proof ("others agree")

### What to Write About
- Give examples from online language you have seen (a post, a comment thread, a campaign tweet)
- Explain how the language works *and* how the platform affects it
- Discuss whether it persuades effectively and why

### Simple Examples
- Hashtags like #SaveOur... / #StopThe... to frame an issue
- Short calls-to-action: "Sign", "Share", "Read this"
- Polite vs aggressive comment styles and their impact
`,
        intermediate: `## Digital Communication and Social Media Persuasion (Intermediate)

Explore how computer-mediated communication (CMC) shapes persuasive language, creating distinctive patterns of style, interaction and identity.

### Digital-Specific Linguistic Features
- Graphology/orthography: emoji, capitalization, spacing, repeated letters ("soooo"), non-standard spelling
- Compression and ellipsis due to character limits and scrolling reading
- Discourse features: threads, quoting, hyperlinks, hashtags as metadiscourse
- Speech acts online: requests, directives, challenges, apologies and "call-outs"
- Stance and alignment: hedging, boosters, evaluative lexis, irony and meme-like phrasing

### Platform and Context Considerations
- "Context collapse": one post reaches multiple audiences with different expectations
- Participation frameworks: public vs private messages, anonymity, moderation rules
- Institutional persuasion online: school/university emails, public service messaging, workplace communication

### Analysis Points
- How politeness and face-work change online (directness, mitigation, threat)
- How social proof and community norms influence uptake (likes, replies, pile-ons)
- Evaluation of effectiveness: reach and speed vs clarity, nuance and misunderstanding
`,
        advanced: `## Digital Communication and Social Media Persuasion (Advanced)

Analyse how digital environments reshape persuasive discourse through changes in interaction, audience design and pragmatic meaning-making.

### Pragmatics and Interaction in CMC
- Examine implicature, presupposition and inference in short-form texts (what is "left unsaid")
- Analyse turn-taking in comment threads: adjacency pairs, repair, escalation, and conflict management
- Explore identity performance and audience accommodation (link to Giles' Accommodation Theory and style-shifting)

### Power, Ideology and Gatekeeping
- Consider how moderation policies, community norms and platform affordances shape what counts as persuasive
- Examine misinformation strategies linguistically (false certainty, pseudo-evidence, rhetorical questions, loaded terms)
- Explore how institutional voices adopt informal features to seem relatable (synthetic personalisation)

### Emerging Issues (Language-Focused)
- AI-generated persuasive texts and bots: formulaic patterns, repetition, and the imitation of human stance
- Micro-targeted messaging: how lexical choice and framing adapt to different audiences
- Ethical evaluation: transparency, manipulation, and digital literacy

### Evaluation Criteria
- Audience diversity and differential reception across communities
- The balance of emotion, evidence and credibility in online persuasion
- How platform constraints influence meaning and misunderstanding
